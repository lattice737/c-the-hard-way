ISBLANK(3)                 Library Functions Manual                 ISBLANK(3)

NAME
     isblank – space or tab character test

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <ctype.h>

     int
     isblank(int c);

DESCRIPTION
     The isblank() function tests for a space or tab character.  For any
     locale, this includes the following standard characters:

     ``\t''`` ''

     In the "C" locale, a successful isblank() test is limited to these
     characters only.  The value of the argument must be representable as an
     unsigned char or the value of EOF.

RETURN VALUES
     The isblank() function returns zero if the character tests false and
     returns non-zero if the character tests true.

COMPATIBILITY
     The 4.4BSD extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the
     unsigned char type in locales with large character sets is considered
     obsolete and may not be supported in future releases.  The iswblank()
     function should be used instead.

SEE ALSO
     ctype(3), isalnum_l(3), iswblank(3), ascii(7)

STANDARDS
     The isblank() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (“ISO C99”).
